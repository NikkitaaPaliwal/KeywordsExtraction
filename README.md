# KeywordsExtraction
**Named entity recognition (NER)** , also known as entity chunking/extraction , is a popular technique used in information extraction to identify and segment the named entities and classify or categorize them under various predefined classes.

When we have large corpus containing different keywords related to different domain,NER comes in action in those scenarios.
NER can be beneficial in news headlines.
